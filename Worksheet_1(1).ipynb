    "### This notebook contains the first set of exercises for the Open Quantum Systems course. By completing these exercises, you will learn methods to predict the dynamics of open quantum systems while also getting experience of programming in Python. Each of the 8 questions below is worth up to 4 marks. When completing the numerical exercises, please remember the following guidelines:\n",
    "### - *Attempt each question*, even if you don't think you can solve it fully. \n",
    "### - *Comment* your code to explain what each part does. You will gain marks for well-commented code even if it does not exactly solve the problem. You will also lose marks for poorly commented code even if you get everything 100% correct.\n",
    "### - Define variables and functions to make your code more readable and adaptable. This is especially useful when repeating the same calculation with different parameters.\n",
    "### - Don't be afraid to look online for help! The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/#) is a good place to start but you can find many other useful sources with your favourite search engine.\n",
